### CSS Selector Exercises (styles.css)

1. Select all paragraphs inside the container and give them a background color of light gray.

2. Select the first and last child of any unordered list inside the container and add a border around them.

3. Target the second paragraph within the container and give it a different font color.

4. Select all direct children of the container and apply a different background color to even and odd elements.

5. Target any anchor element with an `href` attribute starting with "https" inside the container and underline them.

6. Select all paragraphs that are siblings of a heading (both preceding and following) and give them a margin.

7. For this exercise, create a structure where you have nested divs inside the container, and you need to select a specific paragraph that is a child of the second nested div and apply a unique style to it.

8. Create a structure with nested elements inside the container. The goal is to apply a unique style to the last paragraph of each set of nested elements, but only if the set contains at least one element with a class of "highlight." The last paragraph should have a red background color and white text color. Additionally, apply a border to the highlighted element within each set.
